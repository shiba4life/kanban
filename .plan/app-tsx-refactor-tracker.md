# App.tsx Refactor Tracker

## Purpose
- Keep a durable, detailed source of truth for the `web-ui/src/App.tsx` refactor.
- Preserve context across compactions so no important detail is lost.
- Track progress with explicit checklist items that get checked off as work completes.

## Scope
- In scope: `web-ui/src/App.tsx` and new files created to extract logic from it.
- In scope: architecture cleanup in `web-ui/src/kanban/**` that supports App decomposition.
- Out of scope for this plan: `src/cli.ts` and runtime backend refactors.

## Baseline Snapshot
- Current `App.tsx` size: 2902 lines
- Hook density in `App.tsx`: 60 `useCallback`, 24 `useEffect`, 24 `useMemo`, 22 `useState`
- File history count for `App.tsx`: 85 commits touching the file
- High churn domains from history: board/task flow, git actions, terminal/session controls, workspace/project switching

## Refactor Goals
1. Reduce `App.tsx` to a composition shell focused on layout and wiring.
2. Move orchestration logic into focused hooks with narrow interfaces.
3. Remove duplicated logic and centralize shared helpers.
4. Preserve behavior fully while making the code easier to test and evolve.
5. Keep changes incremental and shippable in small PR-sized slices.

## Non-goals
- No user-facing redesign.
- No protocol or backend behavior changes.
- No broad rewrite of existing stable feature modules unless needed for extraction boundaries.

## Target Shape

### Desired end-state metrics
- `App.tsx` target size: 400 to 700 lines.
- `App.tsx` should mainly contain:
  - top-level state that truly spans multiple domains
  - hook composition and prop mapping
  - top-level layout render tree
- Non-layout event orchestration should live in extracted hooks.

### App shell responsibilities
- Render top-level layout and route between home and detail surfaces.
- Compose domain hooks and wire their contracts together.
- Build final component props for:
  - `TopBar`
  - `ProjectNavigationPanel`
  - `KanbanBoard`
  - `CardDetailView`
  - dialogs and alerts
- Keep only minimal cross-domain glue state that cannot reasonably belong to one domain.

### App shell should not own
- Direct tRPC mutation/query orchestration for specific feature domains.
- Domain-specific side-effect coordination (git, terminal, project navigation, task session lifecycle).
- Duplicate utility logic that already exists in other hooks.

### Proposed module layout
```txt
web-ui/src/kanban/app/
  app-shell.tsx                     // optional wrapper if App.tsx still large
  app-domain-types.ts               // shared contracts between extracted hooks
  use-workspace-sync.ts
  use-project-navigation.ts
  use-task-editor.ts
  use-task-sessions.ts
  use-git-actions.ts
  use-terminal-panels.ts
  use-board-interactions.ts
```

### Shared utility cleanup
- Create a single helper module for detail-view task sequencing utilities currently duplicated in:
  - `web-ui/src/App.tsx`
  - `web-ui/src/kanban/hooks/use-linked-backlog-task-actions.ts`
- Candidate module path:
  - `web-ui/src/kanban/utils/detail-view-task-order.ts`
- Candidate exports:
  - `isDetailViewColumnId(columnId)`
  - `getNextDetailTaskIdAfterTrashMove(board, taskId)`

### State ownership guide
- `App.tsx`
  - only cross-domain glue state
- Domain hooks
  - own domain state and transitions
- Presentational components
  - avoid new side-effect orchestration; consume handlers and render

### Side-effect policy
- Keep network and runtime side effects inside domain hooks.
- Keep side-effect ordering unchanged while extracting.
- Prefer explicit action methods over exposing raw setters across domains.

### Contract style for extracted hooks
- Each hook should export:
  - a typed input object
  - a typed output object
  - no hidden reliance on global mutable state
- Keep callback names aligned with current handler naming to minimize migration risk.
- Hook naming convention: do not prefix with `app`; prefer domain-first names like `useTaskSessions`, `useGitActions`, `useTerminalPanels`.

### Migration sequencing rules
- Extract one domain hook per phase.
- Preserve behavior first, simplify second.
- After each extraction phase:
  - run validators
  - run smoke checks for affected domain
  - update this tracker before continuing

### Testing shape after decomposition
- Add focused unit tests for pure helper modules extracted from App logic.
- Prefer domain-hook tests for branching behavior that currently sits in App callbacks.
- Keep integration confidence via existing app-level tests and smoke checklist.

## Constraints and Safety Rules
- Preserve all existing runtime behavior.
- Do not introduce `any` types.
- Follow existing Blueprint and project conventions.
- Prefer extracting code as-is first, then simplify after parity.
- Validate each phase before moving to the next phase.

## Master Todo List

### Extraction order and acceptance checks
1. Phase 1: shared helper deduplication
   - Acceptance checks
     - One shared implementation exists for detail-view next-task selection.
     - `App.tsx` and `use-linked-backlog-task-actions.ts` both import shared utility.
     - Focused utility tests pass.
2. Phase 2: session and workspace API extraction
   - Acceptance checks
     - All session/worktree API calls are moved from App to `useTaskSessions`.
     - No regressions in task start, stop, send input, and trash cleanup flows.
3. Phase 3: git extraction
   - Acceptance checks
     - App no longer owns git polling and action orchestration details.
     - Top bar git actions and review commit/PR task actions preserve behavior.
4. Phase 4: terminal extraction
   - Acceptance checks
     - Home and detail terminal lifecycle logic moves to `useTerminalPanels`.
     - Hotkeys still target correct terminal surface based on selection context.
5. Phase 5: project navigation extraction
   - Acceptance checks
     - URL sync, popstate, add/remove/select, and fallback flows move to `useProjectNavigation`.
     - Project switch loading behavior parity is maintained.
6. Phase 6: task editor and board interactions extraction
   - Acceptance checks
     - Create/edit state is owned by `useTaskEditor`.
     - Drag/start/trash/review-comment orchestration is owned by `useBoardInteractions`.
7. Phase 7: App shell slimming
   - Acceptance checks
     - App acts primarily as composition and layout shell.
     - No dead callbacks/state remain from pre-extraction implementation.
